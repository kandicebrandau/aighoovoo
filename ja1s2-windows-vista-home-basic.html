Hey, I recently reinstalled Windows Vista on an older machine using an iso off of the internet. It's recently came up saying how it's not a valid key i'm using, which confused me at first. I've only just realized that the key I have is for Vista Home Premium and i've installed Home Basic.

Hi r/software, So a new, elderly acquaintance of mine used to do some basic image editing as well as occasional video editing, mostly using Picasa. For reasons unknown, a newer version of Picasa was installed, so the new layout and functionality take a lot of getting used to.
